# consumer-Goods-Analytics
In the "Consumer Goods Domain" project for Atliq Hardwares, I tackled the challenge of making data-driven decisions by responding to ten ad-hoc requests to extract actionable insights. The findings highlighted a notable rise in unique products, a leading 'Notebook' segment, and a thriving 'Accessories' category. We identified sales seasonality and the crucial role of the 'Retailer' channel.

Key takeaways included the transformative power of data analytics for informed decision-making, the dynamic nature of the consumer goods market, the importance of product diversity, the necessity of understanding seasonality, and the impact of distribution channels on sales outcomes.

This project significantly enhanced my data analysis, problem-solving, and communication skills, contributing to my growth as a data analyst. Using SQL queries, I addressed the ten ad-hoc requests, making data the guiding force for Atliq's success. Tools like SQL, Excel were instrumental in uncovering key insights.
